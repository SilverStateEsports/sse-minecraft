# Silver State Esports Factions Event Ruleset

_Currently being worked on - not ready for distribution_

_Updated August 29, 2020_

## Preface

It's become increasingly clear that creating a consise and clear ruleset for the Factions War event that is hosted on Silver State Esports' Minecraft server is necessary in order to keep the community together and not end in chaotic toxicity. We're not an anarchy server, and we don't strive to be - this server is meant to be some competitive fun, not a toxic hellscape, and in order to keep that order, we're establishing some rules.

## 1. Community

The first section of rules applies to the community aspect: interacting with otheres outside of the context of Minecraft. These rules mostly apply to how you chat with others and how you chat with your own team. This also applies to how official communications are handled. Below are the listed rules for community.

1. Silver State Esports is not a place for toxicity. Thus, any comments that are interpreted as discriminatory or derogatory to any person or group is banned. This includes comments of a racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, or otherwise discriminatory nature. These are not things you jest about.
2. Use of profane words isn't the end of the world, but please don't overdo it. We're a Minecraft server, not *The Wolf of Wall Street*, so please don't try to break the record for amount of F-bombs dropped within three hours.
3. For faction servers, communicating through a team Discord curated by SSE staff is highly recommended in order to prevent the other team(s) from hearing vital communications. On these servers, it's expected that you follow all Discord and SSE guidelines for communication.
4. These rules aren't comprehensive, but please use common sense when communicating with others. Remember Bill and Ted's rule: "Be excellent to each other."

## 2. In-game

The second section of rules applies to the gameplay aspect: rules within Minecraft. These rules apply to interacting with others and with the game. Below are the listed rules for in-game.

1. During events, there are two different states: times of truce, and times of war. In times of truce, you are not to engage in any hostile activity towards the other team: doing so is strictly forbidden. In times of war, go for it.
2. Once you select a team, you are set to be on that team for the duration of the event. You are not allowed to join the other team and commit espionage.
3. Cheating by way of using hacked clients or exploits is strictly forbidden. This creates an unfair advantage for you and doesn't allow other players to have fun. If you are caught using a hacked client for any activity, you will be permanently banned, no question.
4. SSE staff are allowed to play and participate in events. However, any staff that wishes to participate in said events will be stripped of their rank for the duration of the event in order to promote fairness. Of course, they will still have access to admin chat in order to communicate with working staff, but they won't be able to use admin abilities. (Admins on SSE don't have any special abilities such as creative mode.)
